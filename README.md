# Identify_Interstellar_Passengers

In this project data science skills are needed to solve a cosmic mystery. We've received a transmission from four lightyears away and things aren't looking good.

While rounding Alpha Centauri en route to its first destination—the torrid 55 Cancri E—the unwary Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. Sadly, it met a similar fate as its namesake from 1000 years before. Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension!

To help rescue crews and retrieve the lost passengers, we are challenged to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceship’s damaged computer system.
